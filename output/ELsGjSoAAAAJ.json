        "abstract": "The spectacular increasing of Data is due to the appearance of networks and smartphones. Amount 42% of world population using internet [1]; have created a problem related of the processing of the data exchanged, which is rising exponentially and that should be automatically treated. This paper presents a classical process of knowledge discovery databases, in order to treat textual data. This process is divided into three parts: preprocessing, processing and postprocessing. In the processing step, we present a comparative study between several clustering algorithms such as KMeans, Global KMeans, Fast Global KMeans, Two Level KMeans and FWKmeans. The comparison between these algorithms is made on real textual data from the web using RSS feeds. Experimental results identified two problems: the first one quality results which remain for algorithms, which rapidly converge. The second problem is due to the execution time that needs to decrease for some algorithms."

We propose a new approach for the robust problem based on the implementation of an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm and the use of efficient mechanisms to derive the best robust solution that responds to all uncertainties with reduced running times. The computational experiments are performed and improve the objective function of a set of instances with different levels of the uncertainty polytope to obtain the best robust solutions that protect from the violation of time windows for different scenarios."

In general, any security issue may have an impact on WSN efficiency and safety. Many researchers focused on wireless systems security via disclosing vulnerabilities, detecting attacks or securing the network layers. Secure Data Collection is proposed to protect data privacy during data aggregation.

In recent years, many approaches have been developed and attempted to reduce the number of record pair's comparisons in the process while maintaining high matching quality. There are two well-known algorithms, which are the Sorted Neighborhood Method (SNM) and the Blocking algorithms. Being inspired by both algorithms, we propose an Enhanced Duplicate Count Strategy which is a new hybrid approach that creates iterative blocks using windows with dynamic size. It is based on comparing next element with last duplicate found in the current window. Consequently, comparisons are saved, and similarity distance is minimized, which can \u2026"

Several existing data mining techniques often through mining frequent itemsets draw association rules and get to relevant knowledge, but with the rapid arrival of the era of big data, traditional data mining algorithms have been impossible to meet large data's analysis needs. Lately, the PrePost algorithm has been suggested, a new algorithm for mining frequent itemsets based on the idea of N-lists. PrePost in most cases outperforms other present state-of-the-art algorithms. In mind of this, we present the HPrePostPlus algorithm. A better version of PrePost based on Hadoop, that utilization a HashMap to traverse effectively the PPC tree, and improve the process of creating the N-lists related with 1-itemsets. We combine also the characteristic of Hadoop with a view to process large data. Experience has demonstrated that HPrePostPlus algorithm is greater than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and scalability."

La surface inf\u00e9rieur est plane anim\u00e9 d'une vitesse horizontal, la surface sup\u00e9rieure est mobile. L'espace entre les deux surfaces est rempli de fluide lubrifiant incompressible ou compressible dans le contexte de m\u00e9canique des films minces, ce fluide ob\u00e9it \u00e0 l'\u00e9quation de Reynolds. La premi\u00e8re partie de ce travail porte sur un probl\u00e8me dynamique incompressible. On \u00e9tudie d'abord le comportement asymptotique de la solution de l'\u00e9quation et de l'in\u00e9quation de Reynolds quand la hauteur tend vers 0 pour diff\u00e9rentes formes g\u00e9om\u00e9triques de celle-ci.

Through our analysis, we expect to find the best compromise between the reduced running time and a best good solution, which leads to four distinct combinations of parallel/sequential approaches. The computational experiments are performed and tested on Solomon\u2019s benchmark and large randomly generated instances.

Recently, the PrePost algorithm has been proposed, a new algorithm for mining frequent itemsets based on the idea of N-lists. PrePost in most cases outperforms other current state-of-the-art algorithms.

Privacy protection require additional controls and communications overloads, which impact the overall network lifetime. Research community has proposed several scenarios to minimize the impact of data protection generally based on secure aggregation and encryption to meet the practical requirements of energy constraints imposed by WSN. However, efficiency of privacy protection must be assessed before deployment. The privacy protection mechanisms are evaluated based on their hackability and network performance using four main metrics: Control Packet Overhead, delay, Throughput, Packet delivery ratio. The purpose of this paper is to propose a secure aggregation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. The new scheme will be will be compared to another scheme based on network metric and attack detection accuracy to have full view on the scheme performance for both network and security metrics. The proposed scheme named \u201cCluster-based Semi-Homomophic Encryption Aggregated Data\u201d(CSHEAD) offer better performance as it reduces the controls overhead with higher detection accuracy.

        "abstract": "Frequent itemset mining is a fundamental element with respect to many data mining problems directed at finding interesting patterns in data. Recently the PrePost algorithm, a new algorithm for mining frequent itemsets based on the idea of N-lists, which in most cases outperforms other current state-of-the-art algorithms, has been presented. The performance of PrePost algorithm degrades when it comes to processing of big data. However, the existing parallel Prepost algorithms implemented with the MapReduce model are not efficient enough for iterative computation. In view of this, this article proposes a parallel algorithm based on the Spark RDD Framework, which enhances PrePost that uses also a hash table to improve the process of creating N-lists and Excombines the features of Spark in order to process large data efficiently. Experiments show that Our approach algorithm is more superior than MRPrePost in \u2026"

These tiny devices have limited power (generally a battery for the full sensor lifetime) and reduced computing resources and memory. WSN are deployed for many applications like environment monitoring and health monitoring. In order to reduce the energy consumption and increase the WSN life, adapted network protocols like routing and data aggregation are used. The scheduling of the communications also allow better management of active/idle status and hence optimize the energy consumption. Classical data compression and decompression algorithms are not adapted to WSN as requiring high memory and computation resources. Compressed sensing is an emerging method with practical results in fields like medical imaging. The \u2026"

It scans entire dataset in every iteration to come up with the large frequent itemsets of various cardinality, which sounds efficient for small data but not useful for big data. To resolve the problem of treatment dataset in every iteration, we present an algorithm called Hybrid Frequent Itemset Mining on Hadoop (HFIMH) which uses the vertical layout of dataset to solve the problem of treatment the dataset in every iteration. Vertical dataset conveys information to discover support of every itemsets, and the idea of set intersection is utilized to compute it. We compare the execution of HFIMH with another Hadoop based implementation of Apriori algorithm for different datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is better."

Studies predict that just under 4 trillion gigabytes of data will exist on earth. This has created a problem related to the processing of the data exchanged, which is rising exponentially and should be automatically treated. This paper presents a classical process of knowledge discovery databases for treating textual data. This process is divided into three parts: pre-processing, processing and post-processing. In order to improve the classical process, we propose to introduce synonyms reduction before the processing step. This introduction, based on dictionaries, reduces the size of documents. "
